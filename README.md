# Testlet
Testlet is a Ruby on Rails based website, it targets for managing all kinds of tests, the name is inspired by Servlet, Portalet, Kubelet and most importantly Quizlet, besides coincidently I found out my first Github project name is “test”.

## Motivation
* Manage various tests for effecient learning 
* Refresh my techie brain to be latest with Rails, Docker and 

## Roadmap
### Milestone 1
Bootstrap a Rails 5.2 based website and package it into a docker-compose based app, which could be deployed to any docker env and usable for:
* Import choices (multiple/single) from CSV
* Create a testlet based on all the choices
* Running test for one or multiple times
* Show and persist result, capable for exporting to CSV
